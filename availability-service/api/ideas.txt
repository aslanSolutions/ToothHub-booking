The website is designed to be fault-tolerant with a focus on maintaining continuous service availability for users. 
One potential point of failure is when the broker becomes unreachable, 
or the service intended to receive a message from the broker faces connectivity issues. 
To ensure availability and prevent data loss, a dedicated service, serving both dentists and patients, 
will actively log errors and store data for subsequent retries. Once the broker is online again, 
the service will automatically attempt to resend the messages, 
ensuring seamless communication between all parties.

In situations where multiple users attempt to book the same date, only one will successfully secure the appointment. 
The booking service initiates the process by sending a message containing the desired booking date
to the broker. Before proceeding, the booking service awaits an acknowledgment message from the broker. 
The broker, in turn, forwards the message to the availability service to check the selected date's 
current status. If the date is available, an acknowledgment message is published to the broker, 
allowing the booking service to proceed with the appointment reservation. 
If the selected date has already been taken, the user will receive a prompt indicating 
that the date is no longer available. They will be advised to either choose an alternative 
time slot or add the current slot to their wish list.
